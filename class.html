<h2>ABOUT US</h2>

<p>M.S.S. Public School was started in 2000.
     Owned and managed by well-known social and educational organization MUSLIM SERVICE SOCIETY (M.S.S.), Calicut, it offers kids the right atmosphere to learn regular lessons, understand the power of education and enjoy co-curricular activities.
      The school is open for boys and girls belonging to all sections, strata and communities.
       The curriculum here is meant for giving children effective coaching, individual attention, diligent care and practice in systematic study habits.
        The institution is keen on imparting religious/ moral instruction to all students.
         "Ideal Man, Ideal Society" is the motto of this institution. 
        There are 1139 students, 46 Teaching staff and 17 non-teaching staff, on the roll. 
        We would like to remember a Quote by Rabindranath Tagore that "We may become powerful by knowledge, but we attain fullness by compassion. 
        The highest education is that, which does not merely give information.
         These are the words which we try to fulfill in this institution.
         The purpose of our education is that every student who passes through the gateway of this school learns to be a good human, showing plenty of concern for the need of our nation.
